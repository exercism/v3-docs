# Copy for the Exercism website

This document is obviously incomplete, right now it merely serves as a way to save a question & answer from the Slack paywall.

## Why are Mentoring Notes not in the track repo?

> The problem here is that there is a team of mentors who review website-copy notes.
> It is (and will increasingly be) quite a noisy process.
> So it will mean that there are thousands of extra PRs going to the track repos, and that either maintainers need to merge them, or we need to give repo-write access to people who don’t currently have it.
> We could do stuff with codeowners to block mentors merging stuff on non-mentor notes, but it will mean things like permissions and notifications get more messy/confusing for maintainers.
>
> In terms of centralising them having the desired effect, that repo has had over 1,700 PRs merged without it bothering the maintainers (other than the ones that work there), so I think that it’s been a relatively successful way of achieving that goal.
>
> There’s also a cultural thing here to consider.
> The quality-control on mentor notes is relatively low, so they can be iterated on quickly.
> Maintainers tend to have a much more rigorous desire for what goes into their track repos (as can be seen by the slow progress of Concept Exercises on many tracks).
> If mentor contributions went through that rigourous PR process, contributions would quickly dry up.
> So maintainers would have to be willing to just wave a lot of stuff through that’s not “as good” as they would choose to do themselves.
